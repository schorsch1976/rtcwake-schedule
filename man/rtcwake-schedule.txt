.SS Check stay awake
.PP
When the machine is still up and it is in the off time of the schedule, it checks the \fBCheckStayAwake=...\fR script. This script could use whatever it
needs
to
check if the machine should stay still awake. The authors NAS, checks for open connections using netstat and checks logged in users. This script prints a number of reasons to stay awake. In fact the program interprets every other output than "0" as a reason to stay awake.

.B Always shut down at the specified time

.nf
# Check Stay awake
# An output of <> "0", not ret_val, output on stdout, let it stay awake
# here the machine always stay awake
CheckStayAwake=echo 0
.fi

.PP
.B Check for open connections before shutting down

.nf
# Check Stay awake
# An output of <> "0", not ret_val, output on stdout, let it stay awake
# here the machine always stay awake
CheckStayAwake=netstat | grep tcp | wc -l
.fi

.SS PowerDown
This command gets executed with %d replaced with the seconds needed to wait to the next wake up time.

.nf
# Power down to off state
PowerDown=/usr/sbin/rtcwake -m off -s %d
.fi
